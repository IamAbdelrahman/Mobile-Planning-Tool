# Mobile-Planning-Tool

This project involves the development of a PYTHON-based planning tool for a
service provider operating in the 900 MHz band with 340 channels. The objective
is to create a user-friendly tool that enables network optimization based on specific
parameters. Key inputs such as the Grade of Service (GOS), city area, user density,
minimum Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIRmin), and sectorization method are
required. The tool utilizes the Hata propagation model, which is suitable for
urban-medium city environments, to enhance the planning process.
